# Google Analytics MCP: Setup & Working Rules

The official Google Analytics MCP server
([googleanalytics/google-analytics-mcp](https://github.com/googleanalytics/google-analytics-mcp),
PyPI package `analytics-mcp`), wired in so the assistant reads GA4 reports
directly instead of the owner exporting screenshots by hand.

**Read this before any GA MCP work.** Companion folder:
[`../Figma/Figma_MCP_Rules.md`](../Figma/Figma_MCP_Rules.md).

## 0. Setup facts

> **Setup step: fill this table once the server is connected, then delete this block.**
> Until then, leave the honest state ("not wired yet"). The Cloud project, the
> service account and the GA4 property are asked at the first analytics
> request, not at install.

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Cloud project | `{{GCP_PROJECT_ID}}` |
| Service account | `{{SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}}` (GA role: Viewer on the property) |
| Key file | an absolute path OUTSIDE the repo; named only in the untracked `.mcp.json` |
| GA4 property | `{{GA4_PROPERTY_ID}}` |

**An analytics request with no server connected is the START of the setup,
never the end of the task.** Do not answer that there is no analytics and
stop. Do sections 1 and 2 below as far as you can from here (the venv, the
`.mcp.json.example`, the exact grant the owner has to make), ask for the
owner's part in one message, say a restart is needed, verify with one small
read, and then answer the question that was asked.

## 1. Install shape

- **Server**: `analytics-mcp` (Python), installed into a project-local virtual
  environment at `project-os/mcp/Google_analytics/.venv/`. Self-contained: nothing
  system-wide, no `pipx` or `uv` needed.
- **Registration**: `.mcp.json` at the repo root, server name
  `google-analytics`, pointing at the absolute path of the venv launcher
  (`.venv/Scripts/analytics-mcp.exe` on Windows, `.venv/bin/analytics-mcp` on
  macOS or Linux; a clone on the other system changes that part of the path
  too), so the server starts with the assistant in this project only.
- **Not in git, for two different reasons.** `.venv/` is gitignored because it
  is ~100 MB of regenerable dependencies (rebuild recipe in §4). `.mcp.json` is
  gitignored because it names the key file's location on disk; commit
  `.mcp.json.example` with placeholders instead, and a fresh clone copies it,
  fills its two paths, and sets the browser entry to its own system's form
  (Installation.md 6d step 3). When the ProjectOS install created `.mcp.json`,
  it also gitignored it and wrote `.mcp.json.example` beside it, so the key
  path can go straight in. Only a project that already tracked `.mcp.json`
  before the install still has it in git, and gitignoring a file git already
  tracks does not keep it out. There, before the key path goes in, copy its
  other entries into `.mcp.json.example`, then untrack it with
  `git rm --cached .mcp.json`. That keeps the file on this machine only: once
  the commit is pushed, every other copy of the project loses its `.mcp.json`
  at its next pull, browser and Figma entries included. Say so in the reply:
  another computer copies `.mcp.json.example` to `.mcp.json` again after
  pulling.

## 2. Authorization

Prefer a **service-account key** over the gcloud CLI: nothing installed
system-wide, and no login that expires.

1. In the Cloud project, create a service account and one JSON key.
2. Grant that account **Viewer** on the GA4 property
   (GA: Admin, Property access management).
3. Keep the key file at a path OUTSIDE the repo.
4. `.mcp.json` carries only the PATH, never the key:

```json
"env": {
  "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS": "<absolute path to the key file, outside the repo>"
}
```

- **Enable BOTH APIs in the Cloud project, Admin and Data.** They are separate
  APIs, and enabling only one is the most common setup failure.
- The server itself reads no environment variables; it calls
  `google.auth.default()`, and Google's auth library is what reads
  `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`.
- **Replacing the key.** A new key does not switch the old one off; the old one
  keeps working until it is deleted. If the key leaks: in the Cloud Console
  (IAM and Admin, Service Accounts, the account, Keys tab), disable the leaked
  key first (its ID is the `private_key_id` inside the old file), then add a new
  JSON key, drop it at the outside-the-repo path, update the one line, restart
  the assistant, confirm one small read works, and delete the disabled key. If
  it only aged out, the same steps, with the old key disabled and deleted last.
  The GA-side grant is on the account, not the key, so it survives untouched.
  The owner does the Console steps; the assistant names them.
- A synced folder (Dropbox and the like) is acceptable for a READ-ONLY viewer
  key; it would not be for a write-capable one.
- Never commit the key file. The rule is: keys live outside the project root.

Alternative, kept for reference: `gcloud auth application-default login` with
the analytics readonly scope, signed in as the account that owns the property.
The trade-off is a system-wide CLI install plus a login that can expire.

## 3. Rules for the assistant

1. **Never guess numbers.** Every analytics figure in a reply comes from a tool
   call, quoting the property and date range used. No estimating, no rounding
   a number you did not fetch.
2. **State the property.** An account can hold several GA4 properties; say
   which one a report came from.
3. **Read-only stays read-only.** Do not propose or run anything that changes
   GA settings; if a change is needed, describe it for the owner to do in the
   GA UI.
4. **Sampling and thresholds are real.** GA4 can withhold or sample rows; if a
   response carries a sampling or data-threshold flag, say so instead of
   presenting the number as exact.
5. **No analytics data in committed files** without the owner asking; reports
   go in chat, or in the project's notes folder if the owner wants them kept.
6. Report METHOD rules (what a standing report contains, which visitors are
   excluded, how visit length is counted) are project decisions; when they
   accumulate, give them their own file under `project-os/` and point at it
   from here.

## 4. Rebuilding the venv (after a restore, or if it breaks)

Windows:

```shell
python -m venv "<project root>/project-os/mcp/Google_analytics/.venv"
"<project root>/project-os/mcp/Google_analytics/.venv/Scripts/python" -m pip install analytics-mcp
```

macOS or Linux:

```shell
python3 -m venv "<project root>/project-os/mcp/Google_analytics/.venv"
"<project root>/project-os/mcp/Google_analytics/.venv/bin/python" -m pip install analytics-mcp
```

In PowerShell, put `& ` before the quoted path on the second line; Git Bash and
the old Command Prompt take the Windows block as it is. `analytics-mcp` needs
Python 3.10 or newer, and a stock Mac `python3` is 3.9, so if pip finds no
matching version, ask the owner to install a current Python (python.org or
Homebrew).

Credentials are never restored from here: the key file lives outside the repo
by design. `.mcp.json` is gitignored, so a fresh clone copies
`.mcp.json.example` and fills in its two paths: the venv launcher and the key
file.
