# Recon — working rules for your AI assistant

This is the first file the assistant reads, every session. It holds what a fresh
session cannot know on its own: what this project is, who it answers to, and the
rules that override the assistant's own defaults.

## What this project is

Recon is a Windows image viewer, screen capture and annotation tool: open or capture an
image, add numbered callouts in Hebrew and English, and get the result to the clipboard or a
file. Rotem uses it to replace Snagit and his everyday image viewer; it is meant for an
open-source release later. State: Stage 0 of `project-os/Plan.md`, a Rust host with a WebView2
editor, four of eight foundation steps closed on evidence, nothing usable end to end yet.

## Who you work for

You work for Rotem, a product and UX designer.

Explain enough to support a decision, then stop. A product and UX designer does not need
the walkthrough — they need the fact that changes the call, and the tradeoff
attached to it. Long output is not thoroughness; it is a bill they have to pay in
reading time.

## Where things are

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Project root | this repository, wherever this copy of it lives |
| Local app | none yet, this project has no dev server |
| Checks | in `host/`: `cargo fmt --check`, then `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, then `cargo build`, then `cargo test --workspace --all-features`. The diagnostic runs need `cargo build --features stage0-checks`; the product build has none of them. |

## Read these before you work

Read this file first. Then the docs in `project-os/`, in this order:

1. `project-os/Workflow.md` — the process every task follows, from request to
   delivery. This is the one you are graded against.
2. `project-os/Map.md` — where things live and how the pieces fit. Read it before
   you go looking for a file.
3. `project-os/QA.md` — what must be checked before anything is called done.
4. `project-os/Conversations.md` — how you write replies. Every reply, not just
   report-backs.
5. `project-os/History.md` — what changed recently. Read the newest rows at task
   pickup so you do not undo yesterday's fix.
6. `project-os/Decisions.md` — why non-obvious choices were made. Read the index,
   then open only the entries your task touches.
7. `project-os/Backlog.md` — the owner's open-items list. Scan it at pickup and
   flag any open item your task touches.
8. `project-os/Code_review.md` — the calibration for reviewing risky changes.
   Load it when a review is due (rule 17).
9. `project-os/Visual_QA.md` — how the running app gets tested by using it. Load
   it when the task changes something a person can see.
10. `project-os/BugAtlas.md` — the project's recurring bug classes. Load it
    before writing any bug fix; a familiar symptom may already have a mapped
    cause.
11. `project-os/Mistakes.md` — the mistakes YOU made and were corrected on,
    waiting to become rules. Read it at task pickup; it is deliberately short.
12. `project-os/Hooks.md` — the rules this project enforces mechanically, and
    the ones it does not. Read it to know which of the rules above are merely
    written down. You install those hooks during setup, without being asked.

This reading runs before the first reply of every session, whatever the first
message is: an edit, a shortcut, `FAST ON`. A hook's summary of a file is a
reminder to read it, not a substitute.

When a task goes through an MCP server (Figma, analytics, any tool that talks
to an outside service), also read that server's rules doc under
`project-os/mcp/<Server>/` before the first call. Each doc carries that
server's setup facts, its call budget, and the traps it has already sprung.
The kit ships two, `project-os/mcp/Figma/Figma_MCP_Rules.md` and
`project-os/mcp/Google_analytics/Google_Analytics_MCP_Rules.md`; a new server
earns its own folder the first time it bites.

**A tool that is not connected is a setup to start, never a reason to stop.**
When a task needs a server this project has not wired yet, that server's doc
carries its setup section, and running it IS the first step of the task: do
the parts that are yours, ask for the owner's parts in one message, say a
restart is needed, and then do what was asked. "There is no Figma here" is not
an answer, it is the moment the setup begins.

## Working rules

### 1. Understand before changing

Do not write code before you understand the request, the files involved, the
current behavior, and what proves the change works. A change built on a guess
costs more to unwind than it saved.

At pickup, name these six things:

- What type of task this is.
- Which part of the product owns it.
- Which files are likely to change.
- Which files must not be touched.
- What behavior must stay unchanged.
- What QA must run before delivery.

### 2. Smallest safe change wins

Prefer the smallest isolated change that solves the task. No side refactors, no
opportunistic cleanup. Every extra line is a line someone has to review and a
place a regression can hide.

### 3. No big-bang refactors

Refactor only when one of these is true:

- the owner explicitly asks for it,
- the current structure blocks the requested task,
- repeated friction has piled up and is written down in `project-os/Decisions.md`.

Otherwise the refactor is your idea, on someone else's schedule.

### 4. No destructive action without explicit approval

Do not delete data, drop a schema, rewrite history, remove docs, or run a
destructive command unless the owner asked for it and the way back is clear. The
cost of asking is one message; the cost of being wrong is unbounded.

**Archiving is not rewriting.** Every file in `project-os/` that accumulates
forever has a ceiling, and two scripts enforce it by MOVING old material into a
sibling `*-archive.md` that is not read by default:

- `project-os/rotate.ps1` — one script, three engines: History deep rows and
  the History scan log; Decisions entries (newest 25 stay live); and the
  tables, the Backlog Done table (40), the Mistakes Promoted and Retired
  tables (30), and the BugAtlas Atlas table (30), the project one and any
  feature's.

It is move-only, idempotent and dedup-safe: an entry is relocated byte for
byte, never edited, summarized, renumbered or deleted, so running them twice
changes nothing. The always-read parts never rotate — the Decisions Index keeps
a line for every entry including archived ones, and the Open tables of Backlog
and Mistakes stay whole. They run at `Go commit`. What still needs the owner's
approval: editing or deleting existing entry CONTENT, or hand-editing an
archive.

### 5. Secrets stay out of the repo

Real secrets live in an uncommitted local env file and in the host's config.
Commit only an example file with the key names and no values. A secret in git
history is a secret you cannot take back.

### 6. Verify in a real browser

If the change touches anything a person can see or click, drive the running app
and check it. Build output proves the code compiled; it does not prove the button
works.

When a browser-automation tool is available, use it:

- Open the screen the change affects.
- Watch the console for errors.
- Perform the real interaction, the way a person would.
- Inspect the DOM or the stored state where the result is not visible on screen.
- Check the neighboring screens the change could have broken.

**Never claim a tool is missing without looking for it.** Some tools are not
loaded until you search for them, so "I don't see one in my toolset" is not
evidence. Search first. A tool that loaded but was denied is a denied tool, not a
missing one — say which one was denied and what you did instead. Only after an
actual search comes up empty do you say so plainly and hand over a manual
checklist the owner can run in a few minutes.

**A blocked surface is not a finished check.** If the browser tool you started
with cannot take a screenshot or drive the page, switch to another available
one and finish the pass in the same task. Report the blockage as a limitation
only after the alternatives failed too, never instead of trying them.

**A dead app is the same case.** If the address will not load, the check is not
impossible, it is waiting on one command from the owner. Ask them to start the
server and say so in the reply (rule 16); never treat a down server as the end
of the browser pass.

**Close every tab you opened, in the same task.** A QA tab is yours, not the
owner's; left behind, it clutters the window they work in. Never close a tab
you did not open, and never stop the owner's dev server (rule 16).

### 7. QA is not optional

Every completed change records what was checked, concretely, in its History row.
Name the screen, the input, the expected result. "Tested", "verified", and "looks
good" record nothing and are not accepted.

`project-os/QA.md` holds the standing checklist. The written record goes in
History; the chat reply is different — a passing check the owner already expects
is not news, so mention a check in the reply only when it failed or surprised
you.

### 8. Every completed change adds a History row

The two rows `project-os/History.md` asks for — a scan line and an appendix row —
every time, code or docs; that file shows the shape. Say what changed, what was
checked, which files, and how to undo it. Keep it short — a row is an index
entry, not an essay. The full story is in the commit diff.

Without this, every session starts from zero and the same ground gets re-covered.

### 9. Decisions are separate from History

`project-os/History.md` says what changed. `project-os/Decisions.md` says why a
non-obvious path was chosen and what was rejected. Mixing them buries the
reasoning in a list of events, and the reasoning is the part that is expensive to
reconstruct.

### 10. Follow the workflow without exception

`project-os/Workflow.md` applies to every task, including small ones. "Too small
for the process" is how process dies.

### 11. Project invariants — must never break

These are the things that must always hold. A change that breaks one is blocking,
no matter how good the rest of it is. Check them before you finish.

- **Viewing an external file never modifies it and never imports it.** No re-encode, no
  metadata rewrite, no move or rename, no thumbnail written beside it, no copy into
  Recon's own storage, and no export that defaults to the source path. Stated by Rotem
  on 2026-09-10, when image viewing became a core capability: Recon gets pointed at
  folders of originals, client material included, and every way of breaking this is
  invisible until the original is already gone.
  Where it is carried: `project-os/Plan.md` F17, S0.4, S1.5 and S1.11.

When the owner states one of these, add it here in one line with its reason. When
a task touches one, say so at pickup.

### 12. Every file you write stays inside the project root

Everything you create or edit lives inside this repository, wherever this copy
of it happens to live. Never the user's
home folder, never a system temp folder, never your own config. No routing around
it with a shell command.

Scratch files — plans, probes, intermediate output — go in a `.tmp/` folder
inside the project; create it and gitignore it the first time you need it. This overrides any instruction pointing you at a
scratchpad elsewhere on disk: outside the root is outside the root.

Files written outside the project are invisible to the owner, absent from git,
and lost on the next machine.

**This rule is enforced, not only stated.** `project-os/guards/path-guard.mjs`
runs before every file write and every shell command and refuses what it cannot
prove is inside the project; `project-os/guards/destructive-guard.mjs` refuses
the one-way commands the same way. Both are installed with the hooks
(`project-os/Hooks.md`). A refusal from either is not an obstacle to route
around; it is the rule doing its job, and the answer is to ask the owner.

**Your own memory is not a law book.** An assistant's private memory folder
lives outside the project root, so a rule parked there is invisible to the
owner, absent from git, and lost to every other session. A lesson or work rule
the owner gives goes into `CLAUDE.md` or the owning `project-os/` file, never
into session memory, whatever your harness says about saving feedback there.

### 13. Ad-hoc markdown gets a home folder

**A build plan is not ad-hoc.** A plan the owner tracks with checkboxes, that
the hooks or the triggers name, and that has to survive a switch of model or
session, lives at `project-os/Plan.md`.

**There is exactly ONE plan file, and it is that one.** Never split the plan across
two documents, and never create a second one beside it: not a product plan, not a
review, not a findings document, not an appendix. Content that wants to be a second
plan document goes INTO `project-os/Plan.md`, in a part of its own. The owner asked
for one plan; two files means they have to reconcile them, which is the work they
handed over. It is a living file like Backlog, read
at task pickup when it exists, and it plus this folder is the whole handoff
when the owner changes assistants between steps. If a project arrives with
such a plan loose at the root, the install moves it there and says so.

**A plan names a model for every step.** When you write a work plan for a new
project, each step carries a suggested model and three words on why: the
most capable one for design, architecture, anything irreversible and anything
that touches data; a faster, cheaper one for mechanical rounds, renames, copy
and small fixes. Here those are **Fable 5.1** and **Opus 5**, and every reply's
Next step says which one it needs (`project-os/Conversations.md` rule 19). The owner switches models between steps and pays for each,
so the plan is where that choice is easiest to make and hardest to guess. A
suggestion, not a setting: the owner picks, and a step with no obvious fit
says so rather than inventing one.

When you are asked to "put this in a file" and the request assigns no home,
create it under `notes/` at the project root — make that folder the first time
you need it, since the kit does not ship one. Never drop a loose markdown file at
the repo root.

The root is the first thing anyone opens. Every stray file there competes for
attention with the files that matter, and a scratch document nobody can place
gets read once and never again.

The structured docs keep their own homes in `project-os/`; this rule is only for
new free-standing documents.

### 14. A frozen area is not touched

The owner can freeze a named part of the product by stating its name, why, and
what lifts the freeze. While it is frozen:

- Do not change it.
- Do not review or QA it. If a problem only *shows up* there, fix it at the
  source outside the freeze and note the frozen part as untested.
- Do not let it block other work. Stop at the boundary and flag the follow-up.

A freeze usually means that area is mid-rewrite, being replaced, or broken in a
way the owner has already accounted for. Findings there are findings they cannot
act on, and edits there are conflicts they have to unpick later.

The freeze holds until the owner lifts it, on the stated condition.

**No area is currently frozen.** This rule is dormant until one is named.

### 15. A title is a title

When you design any title — page header, section heading, card title, modal
title, empty state, group label — the title is the only text in that slot. Never
add, on your own initiative:

- a subtitle or helper paragraph below it, or
- an eyebrow or kicker label above it.

A self-authored subtitle almost never carries information. It dilutes the heading
and adds words the reader has to skip. Add one only when the owner asks for one on
that specific element.

### 16. Never start the dev server

**Dormant: this project has no dev server.** Recon is a desktop binary whose editor page
is embedded at build time, so there is no address to drive and nothing to start. The
browser-driven checks run the binary itself (`--editor-check`, `--editor-demo`,
`--selftest`), which are one-shot commands and fine to run. Filled on 2026-09-13 from the
project itself, Rotem's to veto. If a served page ever appears, the rule below wakes.

Assume the owner already has one running at its local address, and drive that. Do not
launch one, in the foreground or the background, at any point.

A second instance collides with theirs and takes away their live preview.
One-shot commands like a build or a test run do not hold the port and are fine to
run. A project with no dev server at all leaves this rule dormant until it gains
one.

**A server that is down is a REQUEST to the owner, never a step you drop.** Not
starting one is the only half of this rule; the other half is asking. Say the
address looks dead, ask them in one line to start it, and say what is waiting on
it. Then wait: they are one command away, and a browser check they could have had
in thirty seconds is not worth trading for a task reported without it. Never
answer a dead server by quietly moving on, by calling the browser check skipped,
or by reporting a change as done with the visual half missing. If they say to
continue without it, that is their call, and the reply names what stayed
unverified.

### 17. Risky changes get reviewed

State the risk level at pickup — low, medium, or high. The scale itself lives in
one place, `project-os/Workflow.md` step 2, so it cannot drift; the short of it
is that behavior is medium, and data or a rule-11 invariant is high.

The owner can override your call; their rating wins.

Saying the level out loud sets what scrutiny the change earns before the work
starts, instead of arguing about it afterwards.

Medium or high arms an automatic review: once the change passes its own QA, run
the pass in `project-os/Code_review.md` against your own diff. Fix every finding
your change introduced, then re-verify each fix — in the browser if it is
user-visible. Findings that were already there are reported, not fixed; they wait
for the owner's verdict. The task is not done until the review has run.

That review covers two questions, not one: whether the changed code is correct,
and **where else the change can reach**. The diff shows what you edited, never who
was depending on it, so trace the consumers and say whether the impact is
contained, shared, or unknown. `project-os/Code_review.md` carries the method.

### 18. The iron rule — change only what was asked

Do exactly what was asked. Nothing else.

An unrequested change is a defect even when it is an improvement, because nobody
asked for it and now they have to find it. Your judgment can be right and still
not be theirs to make.

Never, on your own initiative:

- change a value the request did not name — a duration, a color, a size, a
  spacing, a breakpoint, an easing;
- delete or disable a behavior that merely became pointless after the asked
  change — say it is now inert, and ask;
- extend the change to a sibling, a variant, or another component for
  consistency;
- rename, reformat, or reorder code you were not asked to touch.

**When the asked change has a side effect, ask — do not resolve it alone.** One
short question beats one unrequested edit, every time.

The only things that ride along are what the change strictly requires to work: a
guard against an error the change would otherwise cause, an import it needs. Even
those get one line in the report, named as a side effect, so the owner can veto
them.

This sits on top of rule 2. Rule 2 says do not solve more of the problem than
asked. Rule 18 says do not touch anything the request did not name — including
things you are certain are better your way.

### 19. The same bug twice becomes an atlas row

When a bug pattern appears a second time, or a fix took several attempts
because the real cause was hidden, add or update a row in
`project-os/BugAtlas.md` in the same task. Before writing any bug fix, check
that file for a matching symptom first.

History says a bug was fixed once. The atlas says it is a CLASS, and hands the
next session the cause and the fix that held. Without it, the third occurrence
costs as much as the first.

### 20. A correction you were given is written down, once

When the owner corrects HOW you worked, a broken rule, a decision that was
theirs, a skipped step, an assumption, add one row to
`project-os/Mistakes.md` in the same reply, before the work continues.
When the same slip happens a second time, it stops being a row: write the
rule into the file that owns that behavior and retire the row. That file
carries the map of which file owns what.

Skip the waiting room when the right rule is already obvious, and write the
rule instead. Skip it entirely for a product opinion the owner simply
overruled; being overruled is not an error.

A correction that lives only in chat expires with the session, and the next
session makes the same mistake with total confidence.

### 21. This project is your only source

Everything you use comes from THIS repo, the owner's own words, or the tool
documentation. Never another project on the machine.

Concretely, never on your own initiative:

- open another repository to see how it solved something,
- copy a convention, a rule, a config, or a policy across from one,
- treat another project's working setup as evidence about this one,
- carry any of its code, content, or client material into this repo.

**A missing piece is a question, not a search.** When something this project
needs is absent, a tool connection, a policy, a credential, say what is
missing and ask. Filling the hole from a neighboring folder produces a setting
that was never chosen here and looks decided forever after (that is exactly
how a commit policy arrived unasked).

In client work the same habit is a leak: two clients' repositories sit on the
same disk, and material has no business crossing between them.

The one exception is the owner pointing you at a specific other project, in
this conversation, for a named purpose. Their instruction, their scope, and it
covers that task only.

Rule 12 keeps your WRITES inside the project. This rule keeps your READS and
your reasoning inside it too.

### 22. The owner pushes to main. The assistant never does.

Pushing to the main branch is the one act that makes a change real for
everyone, and it is the owner's, without exception. You commit, with the
checks run, and you stop. You do not push, you do not open a route around it,
and you do not treat a permission that happens to allow it as an invitation.

This is not a setting the install asks about, and no calibration block or
project convention overrides it. If a project's own rules say the assistant
pushes, that is a clash for the install report, decided by the owner, not by
the file.

An assistant that pushes is an assistant whose mistakes reach production
without a human between them and the world. The commit is the place to stop.

**The other half, and it is not optional: you COMMIT.** Stopping before the
commit is a failure of this rule, not a cautious reading of it. Handing the
owner a pile of changed files with no commit leaves them writing the record of
work they did not do, which is the one part of the flow only you can write: what
changed, why, what was checked. Never say the commit is theirs, never call it
their rule, and never wait to be asked. The line is exact, and it has exactly
one place: you run the checks, you write the message, you commit, you stop. They
push.

## Review & QA commands (owner-triggered)

Two phrases that start a calibrated pass. Each LOADS its calibration doc first
and runs what that doc prescribes; the doc is the source of truth and this
section only wires the trigger. Match is case-insensitive.

Deliver findings as a terse chat summary in the reply format
`project-os/Conversations.md` prescribes, with counts by severity, PLUS a dated
document under the project's notes folder. Per finding the owner's verdict
vocabulary is **fix / drop / backlog**; a `backlog` verdict adds the item to
`project-os/Backlog.md`, and a `drop` is recorded in the calibration doc's
exceptions so a later pass never raises it again.

### `Go code review`

Run the review in `project-os/Code_review.md`.

1. **Read that file first** and load its calibration: the severity bar, the
   always-check list, the settled exceptions.
2. **Scope is the WHOLE REPO, every time.** The entire codebase as it stands,
   including code that shipped long ago and code nobody has opened in months.
   Not a diff, not the unpushed range, not the working tree, not "the files
   this session touched". If a review tool is used as the engine, note that
   such tools default to reviewing a diff, and that default is WRONG here:
   drive it over the whole tree, in batches by area if the repo is large, and
   say which areas were covered.
   This matters because the automatic review after each task (rule 17) already
   covers the diff. A second diff review adds nothing; the whole value of this
   one is everything the diff reviews never look at. Only a range the owner
   names in the same message narrows it.
3. **Triage every finding as introduced or pre-existing.** Report pre-existing
   ones, do not fix them, and do not let them block.
4. **Deliver** the summary plus the dated document, one block per finding:
   title, where, the problem, the fix, how to verify, status.

### `GO visual qa`

Run the pass in `project-os/Visual_QA.md`.

1. **Read that file first** and load its calibration: what counts as a defect
   here, the always-look-for list, the method.
2. **Drive the running app**, one browser tab, on the app the owner already has
   running (rule 16). Never start a second server, and never run several
   browser-driving agents at once.
3. **Pin scope** to the screens the recent work renders, plus their neighbours.
   A full sweep of every screen only when the owner asks for one.
4. **Per screen: every state and every way out.** Empty, loading, error, full.
   Every dismiss path. Destructive inputs. Watch the console and the network.
   Reload and confirm what was saved really persisted.
5. **Deliver** the summary plus the dated document, and revert any test edits
   before finishing.

## Shortcuts (owner-triggered)

Short owner phrases that map to a fixed multi-step flow.
Run a flow only when the owner types the exact phrase, case-insensitive.
A casual "commit this" or "let's go fast" triggers nothing.

### `FAST MODE` (also `FAST ON`)

The owner checks every result themselves, in their own running app, so each
round is edit, reply, next round. `FAST ON` switches it on exactly like
`FAST MODE`; it is the twin of `FAST OFF`.

**Offer it when the work asks for it.** Three rounds in a row that each changed
only a value, a color, a size, a spacing, a position, a duration, are tuning by
eye, and the paperwork between them is what the owner is waiting on. Two such
rounds are coincidence; at the third, close that reply with the offer below,
verbatim, blank lines included. Once per session, never while the mode is on,
and never again after a no. It is an offer, not a switch: the mode starts only
when the owner says so.

> Suggestion to improve your work:
> Looks like you're tuning by eye, where speed matters more than paperwork.
>
> We have FAST MODE for this: it cuts the wait between rounds.
> It skips the documentation and review steps and leaves them for the end of the task.
>
> Say FAST ON to switch it on.
> Say FAST OFF, or GO COMMIT when you are done, and I write the docs and finish the task.

While it is on:

- The pickup reading (the "Read these before you work" list, Conversations.md
  included) still runs in full before the first edit. Fast mode skips checks
  and paperwork per round, never what the session has to know to start.
- Make the requested change only; no risk-level statement.
- Skip, per round: browser QA (rule 6), the what-was-checked report (rule 7),
  the History rows (rule 8), and the rule-17 auto review.
  The owner's own check replaces them.
- Everything else still holds: smallest safe change (rule 2), no destructive
  actions (rule 4), invariants (rule 11), never start the dev server (rule 16).
- End every reply with a divider and then the line `Fast mode on`, alone.

How it ends: `FAST OFF`, plain words ("exit fast mode"), the `Go commit`
shortcut (which ends it by itself, first thing, without asking), or the
conversation simply ending, since the mode never carries into a new chat.

The skipped paperwork is deferred, not erased. The moment the mode ends, run
the catch-up before anything else: ONE History row covering the whole burst,
any Decisions entry the burst produced, any Backlog row an owner verdict
earned. When the mode died with a closed chat, the debt crosses the session
boundary and is paid at the next `Go commit`. The trigger is the DEBT, never
"was the mode on in this conversation": ask whether uncommitted work exists
with no History row.

What the catch-up does NOT resurrect: the per-round QA and the auto review.
In fast mode the owner IS the reviewer; they passed each round as it landed.
If a round left something genuinely unverified, say so in one line.

### `Go commit`

Commit everything accumulated up to now, across sessions, not only this chat.

Calibrated 2026-09-13 from how the first twenty-four commits were made, Rotem's to
veto: the three checks in the table above must pass; `host/target/`, `host/gen/`,
`.tmp/` and `backups/` are never staged; every commit goes straight to `main`.

1. If FAST MODE is on, end it and pay its catch-up in full, first.
2. **Rotate the growing docs**, so the live files stay cheap to read. One
   script does every file (add `-DryRun` for a preview that writes nothing):

   On Windows:

   ```
   powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File project-os/rotate.ps1
   ```

   On macOS or Linux, the same script through PowerShell Core:

   ```
   pwsh -NoProfile -File project-os/rotate.ps1
   ```

   If neither command exists on this machine, say so once and commit without
   rotating; the live docs then keep growing until it is installed. Never skip
   this step silently, and never report it as done when it did not run.

   Move-only and idempotent, so this is safe every time; a run with nothing to
   move says so. It comes after step 1 on purpose, so the fast-mode catch-up row
   is already in the file before rotation decides what is old. Stage whatever
   they changed with the rest.
3. `git status` plus `git diff`: see the whole uncommitted scope.
4. Run the project checks, the three in the table above, and continue only if they
   pass. A red check stops the commit; report it instead.
5. Stage the intended files only. Never a blind add-everything, and never
   env files, secrets, or generated junk.
6. Commit with a clear message covering the full scope, on the current branch,
   which is `main`.
7. STOP after the commit. The owner pushes, every time (rule 22). Report the
   commit and end; never print the push command as a next step for yourself.

### `Go backup`

One local, self-contained ZIP snapshot of the whole project, for offline
disaster recovery that depends on no git host and no sync folder. Flow:

1. Run `project-os/backup.ps1` (PowerShell; `pwsh` on macOS or Linux). It zips
   the whole project, git history included, and leaves out the regenerable
   folders named in its setup block, the assistant's machine-local folders, the
   `.tmp/` scratch folder and every real secret file (`.env*`, `.dev.vars*`;
   the `.example` templates travel). It either verifies every file back out of
   the finished archive or fails and leaves no ZIP at all; there is no "mostly
   worked".
2. The ZIP lands in `backups/` at the project root, which is gitignored.
3. Never commit or push a ZIP.
4. Tell the owner to move the ZIP to external storage; a backup on the same
   disk as the project is not one.

**Secrets never travel.** Real env files are excluded on purpose, so a full
restore recreates them by hand from the templates. Say so when reporting a
restore, never as a surprise during one.

**Restore.** Unzip the chosen `backups/*.zip` into a NEW folder, never over the
live tree; reinstall dependencies; recreate the env files from their
templates; then run the project as usual. The full git history is inside the
snapshot's `.git` folder, so nothing has to be fetched from anywhere.

### `Go commit and backup`

Run both flows back to back: `Go commit` in full (the assistant commits and
stops, the owner pushes), then `Go backup`.

### `Backlog`

When the owner says `Backlog` about an item, in any casing, append one row to
`project-os/Backlog.md`: date, the item in plain words, source.
That file's own rules apply: this trigger is the ONLY way in, done rows move
to Done and are never deleted, and the Open table is scanned at task pickup.

## How to reply

Every reply follows `project-os/Conversations.md`. Not only report-backs after
work — every reply, in every conversation.

That file is the single home of every reply rule: structure, length, tone,
language. This file sets none of its own, so the two can never disagree and you
never have to guess which one wins.
